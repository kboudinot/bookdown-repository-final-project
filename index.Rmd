# Gray wolves

```{r fig.cap = "Wolf howling (Photo credit: P. Rebholz)", fig.align='center', out.width='100%', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path =  "images/wolf_howling.jpg")
```

Gray wolves (*Canis lupus)* historically existed in Idaho until they were extirpated due to human persecution in the early 20th century. Gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, and central Idaho in 1995-1996. Regulated harvest is relatively new for gray wolves in the United States. These populations have expanded leading to removal of the Endangered Species Act protections in 2009. Harvest of wolves began after ESA protections were removed in the Northern Rocky Mountains (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming).

## Study area

This data was collected from across Idaho, USA (Figure 1.2)

```{r fig.cap="Map of Idaho with GMUs", fig.align='center', out.width='50%', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path =  "images/idaho_gmu.jpg")
```

Wolves are harvested with methods including hunting and trapping (Figure 1.3).

```{r fig.cap="Old trap", fig.align='center', out.width='50%', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path =  "images/trap.jpg")
```

To determine the effects of hunting and trapping on gray wolves we use a combination of fieldwork (Figure 1.4) and genetic data sometimes collected as scat (Figure 1.5). 

```{r fig.cap="Surveying for wolves", fig.align='center', out.width='50%', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path =  "images/surveying.jpg")
```

```{r fig.cap="Freshest wolf scat I've ever seen", fig.align='center', out.width='50%', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path =  "images/scat.jpg")
```


## Institution

This data was collected and compiled by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game and the University of Idaho [Gray Wolf Research Group](https://www.graywolfresearch.org/) (Figure 1.3)

```{r fig.cap = "Gray Wolf Research Group", fig.align='center', out.width='40%', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path =  "images/logo.png")
```


```{r eval=FALSE, echo = F}
bookdown::serve_book()
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
