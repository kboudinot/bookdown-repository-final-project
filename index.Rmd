# Gray wolves

Gray wolves (*Canis lupus)* historically existed in Idaho until they were extirpated due to human persecution in the early 20th century. Gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, and central Idaho in 1995-1996. The management of wolves through regulated harvest (i.e., hunting and trapping) is relatively new in the United States. As these populations expanded, protections from the Endangered Species Act were removed in 2009. Following this delisting, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) designated wolves as a big game species and allowed for [regulated harvest](https://idfg.idaho.gov/form/wolf-plan-2023).

## Study area

This data was collected from across Idaho, USA (Figure 1.2)

```{r fig.cap="Map of Idaho with GMUs", fig.align='center', out.width='50%', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path =  "images/idaho_gmu.jpg")
```

Wolves are subject to regulated harvest with methods including hunting and trapping (Figure 1.3). Harvested wolves are required to be checked by IDFG personnel that record data (e.g., method of take). Personnel also remove tissue or tooth samples for later genetic analyses.

knitr::include_graphics(path =  "images/trap.jpg")
```

We also use conduct field work (lots of hiking and howling) (Figure 1.4) to find wolves and collect genetic samples (i.e., scat) (Figure 1.5) from every individual in a study pack. This allows us to obtain individual genetic identifications of wolf packs and in combination with IDFG harvest data allow us to study the potential effects of hunting and trapping on wolves.

## Institution

This data was collected and compiled by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game and the University of Idaho [Gray Wolf Research Group](https://www.graywolfresearch.org/) (Figure 1.6)

```{r fig.cap = "Gray Wolf Research Group", fig.align='center', out.width='40%', echo = F}

```
